# Webmetric challenge by Mojtaba Zarezadeh

## Assignment Points 1 and 2
To run the code use this command in the repository root.

`./gradlew bootRun`

There is a small benchmark here to compare the implementation with `for loop` with the `parallel stream`.
You can see the result by running this code.

```shell
./gradlew bootJar
java -jar -Dmyapp.run-benchmark=true ./build/libs/webmetric_challenge-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
## Assignment Point 3

I don't know much about the recommendation systems and algorithm and tools related to them.
After reading the assignment and searching internet I found out that I can't get a useful result for this point 
in this limited time and without help. So I don't have a solution for this now.
